# The Dalat Vibe Guide

## How We Talk to Users

We're not a bank. We're not an enterprise SaaS. We're a community app for people who love Dalat — the city of flowers, coffee, and eternal spring.

### Tone

- **Warm, not corporate.** "Hey! Looks like something went wrong" not "An error has occurred"
- **Helpful, not robotic.** "Let's get you back in" not "Please retry your authentication attempt"
- **Chill, not anxious.** "Almost there!" not "WARNING: Action required immediately"
- **Playful when appropriate.** A little humor goes a long way, but never at the user's expense

### Error Messages

Bad:
> "Authentication failed. Error code 401."

Good:
> "Hmm, couldn't sign you in. Double-check your password?"

### Success States

Bad:
> "Operation completed successfully."

Good:
> "You're in! Welcome back."

### Loading States

Bad:
> "Please wait while we process your request..."

Good:
> "Brewing your content..." or "Almost ready..."

### Empty States

Bad:
> "No data available."

Good:
> "Nothing here yet — be the first to add something!"

### Rules of Vibe

1. **Read the room.** Playful for uploads and social features. Straightforward for payments and security.
2. **No cringe.** Skip the "Oopsie!" energy. We're cool, not kindergarten.
3. **Respect the moment.** If someone's upload failed after 20 photos, empathy first, charm second.
4. **Keep it short.** Vibes die in long paragraphs.
5. **Dalat flavor.** When it fits, nod to coffee, flowers, fog, motorbikes, and the endless spring.
